# IMPORTANT:
# Do NOT ignore Angular workspace files. Vercel runs `ng build` during deploy.
# If these are ignored, Angular CLI errors with:
# "This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace."
#
# Keep `src/`, `angular.json`, and `tsconfig*.json` included.

# (Optional) If you want to deploy prebuilt assets only, you can revisit this file
# and change the Vercel setup to publish `dist/` without running `ng build`.
